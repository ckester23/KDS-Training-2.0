# KDS-Training-2.0
An improved repository for my KDS Training Program

Author: Cheyanne Kester File: Karate-Do Shotokai Belt Test Training

This file contains functionality to facilitate a Shotokai belt test as a training exercise.

All terms and grading are based off of the "Commonly Used Terms" poster and "Adult Belt Grading Standards" info-sheet. These can be found on the American Karate-Do Shotokai website: shotokai.org

The [Color]Practice functions only contain the newest techniques needed for the specified belt, in addition to the 5 basic stances.

If you wish to do a full training exercise by working on all the techniques you have learned so far, start with the Red belt exercise, then work your way up.

All the techniques are sorted into these categories: Tachikata - Stances Tsuki-te - Hand Techniques / Strikes Geri - Kicks Uke - Blocks General - Other commonly used terms Kata - Kata

This file requires the use of the mp3's in the sound_files folder

Please Note: This is my first post on Github, I am still very new to the formatting of this website, so please forgive my less than optimal organization.
